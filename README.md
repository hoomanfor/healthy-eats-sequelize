# Healthy Eats using 'Sequelize'

Enter the name of a tasty food item and 'Add' it to your plate. You may decide to 'Eat' it or leave it on your plate. No pressure. If you decide to 'Eat' what's on your plate, make sure to select a moment first.

I developed this web app to practice applying the MVC architectural design pattern. MVC is short for 'Model View Controller.' In addition to practicing the MVC design pattern, I've practiced using the Node.js ORM named 'Sequelize.'  

In my architectural design, I have two models I'm associating with each-other. The 'Eat' model and the 'Moment' model. I've added server-side input validation and experimented with various query calls and MySQL Joins.
